### TODO
Fill These out

- How to run your project (or where it is hosted)
  - `cd data-mappage`
  - `yarn start`
- How much time you spent building the project
  - 4 hours
- Any assumptions you made
- Any trade-offs you made
- Any special/unique features you added
  - Used MUI to work faster on components
- Anything else you want us to know about
- Any feedback you have on this technical challenge
- Mockup incorrectly labels the first column as “Systems” when it should be “Applications”
  - Caused quite a bit of confusion starting out deciding what the Task description was referring to as “systems” and the difference between a System and a Data Category.
  - Suggest adding “Convert the sample data (sample_data.json) **containing an array of systems**…” to the requirements bullet 2
  - wasted about 20 min on this
