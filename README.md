# Data Mappage

----------------------- ------------------------------------
💁‍♂️                      Mappin' Systems. Renderin' Data.

------------------------------------------------------------

- How to run your project
  - `cd data-mappage`
  - `yarn start`
- How much time you spent building the project
  - 4 hours
- Any assumptions you made
  - That I would understand the data better once I started working on it. I had a hard time wrapping my head around it. I got most of the way there, and there were a few epiphanies along the way.
- Any trade-offs you made
  - I probably spent too much time setting up the project in a way that I'm used to working so that I could work faster. Ah the irony.
- Any special/unique features you added
  - Decided to treat the various types like tags and used those as filters.
- Anything else you want us to know about
  - Used MUI to work faster using pre-existing UI components without reinventing the wheel.
- Any feedback you have on this technical challenge
  - Mockup incorrectly labels the first column as “Systems” when it should be “Applications”
    - Caused quite a bit of confusion starting out deciding what the Task description was referring to as “systems” and the difference between a System and a Data Category.
    - I suggest adding “Convert the sample data (sample_data.json) **containing an array of systems**…” to the requirements bullet 2
